Lab 3 Exercise:
  1. Format the entirety of this data set as a table.
  2. Calculate into the column “Unemployment Rate” the unemployment rate. Note, this compares the “Unemployed” as a ratio to the “Employed” and not the “Unemployed” to the “Total”.
  3. Format the cells of the “Unemployment Rate” column as percentage.
  4. Format the columns “Median”, “25th percentile of earnings”, and “75th percentile of earnings” as currency with 2 decimal places.
  5. Pivot Table
    a. Use the Pivot Table you created from the dataset to analyze the following per each “Major Category”
      i. Number of Majors
      ii. Sum of Employed
      iii. Sum of Unemployed
      iv. Average of Unemployment Rate (display as %)
      v. Average of Median Income (display as currency)
      vi. Average of 25th Percentile Earnings (display as currency)
      vii. Average of 75th Percentile Earnings (display as currency)
  6. Using this data generated from our pivot table, make the following charts. 
    a. A 2-D Clustered Column Graph comparing:
      i. Major Categories and Average Unemployment
    b. A 2-D Clustered Column Graph comparing:
      i. Major Categories and Average Median Income
    c. A 2-D Clustered Bar Graph comparing each "Major Category" on:
      i. Sum of Employed
      ii. Sum of Unemployed
      
      
      
Lab 3 Answers:
  1. Select a cell within the desired table, press [command] + [a], press [control] + [t]
  2. =[@Unemployed]/[@Employed]
  3. Select the column "Unemployment Rate" and change the format from general to percentage
  4. Select the columns and change the format from general to currency, then increase decimal place
  5. * The pivot table dataset can be viewed in the Excel_Lab3_myTables *
  5a.i.   =COUNTIF(Table1[Major_category],[@[Major Category]])
  5a.ii.  =SUMIF(Table1[Major_category],[@[Major Category]],Table1[Employed])
  5a.iii. =SUMIF(Table1[Major_category],[@[Major Category]],Table1[Unemployed])
  5a.iv.  =AVERAGEIF(Table1[Major_category],[@[Major Category]],Table1[Unemployment_rate])
          Change to percentage, increase decimal
  5a.v.   =AVERAGEIF(Table1[Major_category],[@[Major Category]],Table1[Median])
          Change to currency
  5a.vi.  =AVERAGEIF(Table1[Major_category],[@[Major Category]],Table1[25th percentile of earnings])
          Change to currency
  5a.vii. =AVERAGEIF(Table1[Major_category],[@[Major Category]],Table1[75th percentile of earnings])
          Change to currency
  6a. Created a seperate table consisting of a column with each Major Category and another column with each corresponding Average of Umemployment_rate, the values were manually copied from the pivot table dataset in 5a.
      * The graph can be viewed in the Excel_Lab3_myGraphs, the data table is in Excel_Lab3_myTables *
  6b. Created a seperate table consisting of a column with each Major Category and another column with each corresponding Average of Median, the values were manually copied from the pivot table dataset in 5a.
      * The graph can be viewed in the Excel_Lab3_myGraphs, the data table is in Excel_Lab3_myTables *
  6c. Created a seperate table consisting of a column with each Major Category, a seperate column with each corresponding Sum of Employed, a seperate column with each corresponding Sum of Unemployed, the values were manually copied from the pivot table dataset in 5a.
      * The graph can be viewed in the Excel_Lab3_myGraphs, the data table is in Excel_Lab3_myTables *
