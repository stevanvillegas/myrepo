Documentation of my learning experience with Tableau Prep Builder:



Additional Notes:
  - Connecting to Excel files
  - Check the 'Cleaned with Data Interpreter' box for best results; using this will likely lead to additional automated fields
  - Dragging tables 
  - Multiple files -> wildcard union -> include the additional sheets from the file
  - adding clean steps to tables in the visualization
  - splitting one field into several fields; split values -> automatic split
  - all of the changes are logged on the left side of the selection pane; undo
  - applying recommendations can be very useful
  - excluding nulls will remove the null rows within all fields
  - adding an output and changing the type into a microsoft excel file (.xlsx) -> Full refresh:create table -> saves a version of the tableau file as an excel file
  - creating a union between two tables
  - changing the type to cvs file
  - save flow (can be seen in Tableau_myFlows (1st image)
