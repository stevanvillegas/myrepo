Documentation of my learning experience with Tableau Desktop:



Additional Notes:
- using excel files
- adding new data sources (icon in header)
- using Data -> Edit Blend Relationships -> custom -> select the two tables with the same values to create a link
- dragging measures into Mark Cards -> Color -> Edit Colors
- a red link icon beside a table means it is active
- within the mark card, select a measure -> Add Table Calculation
- Analysis -> Create Calculated Field
    IF SUM(Profit)>0
    THEN
    "Positive"
    ELSE
    "Negative"
    END
- Analytics -> Trend Line -> Linear
- Analytics -> Cluster -> Number of clusters (easily identifies groups)
- Analytics -> Forecast -> (right click) Forecast Options -> Forecast Length
- color 'Red and Green Diverging" is user-friendly
