--************************ GROUP BY ********************

SELECT * FROM production.products;

-- group by for model year (doesnt tell us much, because only access model year)

SELECT model_year FROM production.products GROUP BY model_year;

-- use aggregate functio count() -> count number of rows per group
-- how many products have particular model year

SELECT model_year, COUNT(*) AS '# of products' FROM production.products GROUP BY model_year;

-- count rows in brand id

SELECT brand_id, COUNT(*) AS '# of products' FROM production.products GROUP BY brand_id;

-- count rows in whole table

SELECT COUNT(*) AS '# of products' FROM production.products;



--************************ HAVING ********************

-- set conditions for our groups like a where clause
-- only get back groups that have under 100 products

SELECT model_year, COUNT(*) AS '# of products' FROM production.products GROUP BY model_year HAVING COUNT(*) < 100;

-- not selecting group 2016

SELECT model_year, COUNT(*) AS '# of products' FROM production.products GROUP BY model_year HAVING model_year != 2016;

-- can still use WHERE clause, needs to be before group by, in order to filter the table before
-- it gets grouped

SELECT model_year, COUNT(*) AS '# of products' FROM production.products WHERE list_price > 2000 GROUP BY model_year HAVING model_year != 2016;





--************************ AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS ********************

-- return a value after performing some calculation on a set of values (column)
-- often used with group by

-- COUNT -> count number of rows that match a given criteria
-- AVG -> average value of a column (numeric)
-- MAC -> get max value of a column
-- MIN -> get min value of a column
-- SUM -> returns sum of a column (add everything)

SELECT
    model_year,
    COUNT (*) AS '# of products',
    AVG(list_price) AS 'avg list price',
    MAX(list_price) AS 'highest list price',
    MIN(list_price) AS 'lowest list price',
    SUM (list_price) AS 'sum of list price'
FROM
    production.products
GROUP BY
    model_year;

-- highest average amount of groups

    AVG(list_price) DESC;





--************************ OVER & PARTITION BY ********************

-- OVER clause used to:
-- 1. determine which rows from a query are applied to a function
-- 2. can be used to display group by calculations next to regular rows
