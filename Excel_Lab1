Lab 1

Using Excel_Lab1_Dataset (Airline Safety Data)

Topics Covered:
  - Data Formatting
    - Data Table
    - CellFormat
      - Percentage
  - Conditional Formatting
  - Aggregate Functions
    - Count and CountIF
    - Sum and SumIF
    - Average



Lab 1 Exercise:
  1. Sort the Column “Incidents from 1985-99” in ascending order.
    a. Who has the fewest incidents in the criteria?
    b. Who has the most?
  2. Use Conditional Formatting
    a. Highlight in green any value of “0” for both “Fatal Accidents” Columns.
    b. Highlight in Red on the same column from above fatalities greater than 100.
  3. Count Functions
    a. Using the Count or CountIf function, count how many airlines had greater than 100 fatalities AND greater than 5 incidents, from 1985 to 1999. Record your results.
    b. Repeat the above step for the 2000 – 2014 data.
  4. At the bottom of the Data Set, make a new row that records SUM TOTALS for each column.
    a. Compare the sum totals of the number of incidents between 1985-99 and 2000- 14. Which timeframe had fewer total incidents? Record your answer.
    b. Do the same from above, comparing the fatalities.
  5. Make two new Columns at the Right of the data set. One for “Percent Change Incidents”. One for “Percent Change Fatalities”.
  6. In the columns from Step 5 above:
    a. Calculate the AVERAGE percent change for both columns. Record your answers.



Answers to Lab 1 Exercise:
  1a. Cathay Pacific, Hawaiian Airlines, TAP - Air Portugal
  1b. Aeroflot

  2a. Conditional formatting -> Highlight Cells -> Rules -> Equal to -> 0 = Green
      Equal to 0, Color is green
  2b. First select the entire table -> conditional formatting -> Manage rules -> [+] -> style:classic -> use formula:
        Function: =$H2>100
                  Applies to: $G$2:$G$57
                  Color is red
        Function: =$E2>100
                  Applies to: $D$2:$D$57
                  Color is red

  3a. =COUNTIFS(Table11[Incidents From 1985 - 99], ">5",Table11[Fatalities from 1985 - 99], ">100")
      = 14 airlines
  3b. =COUNTIFS(Table11[Incidents From 2000 - 14], ">5",Table11[Fatalities from 2000 - 14], ">100")
      = 5 airlines

  4a. =MIN(Airline!F59, Airline!C59)
      = 231
      = Incidents from 2000 - 14
  4b. =MIN(Airline!E59, Airline!H59)
      = 3019
      = Fatalities from 2000 - 14 
      
  5. Column = Percent Change Incidents
            =IFERROR(([@[Incidents from 2000 - 14]]-[@[Incidents From 1985 - 99]])/[@[Incidents From 1985 - 99]],1)
     Column = Percent Change Fatalities
            =IFERROR(([@[Fatalities from 2000 - 14]]-[@[Fatalities from 1985 - 99]])/[@[Fatalities from 1985 - 99]],1)
            
  6. =AVERAGE(Table11[Percent Change Incidents])
     = 3%
     =AVERAGE(Table11[Percent Change Fatalities])
     = 42%
  
  
  
Additional Notes:
  - No spaces in syntax
  - In order to reference another sheet that has spaces in the name simply inclose with ' ' Ex. 'Airline Safety Data'!A1
  - Percent Change = (new_value - old_value)/old_value
  - VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, range_lookup)
    vertical (column) lookup
    col_index_num = the column number in table_array from which the matching value should be returned, usually left side
    range_lookup = usually always enter [False], this gives exact values/matches
  - * XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, N/A, 0, 1)
    recommended function to use
  - =IF()
  - =IFS()
  - Logical tests are equations with an operation
    Ex. (A2>=10, "True", "False")
  - =MAX()
  - =XLOOKUP(MAX())
  - =MAXIFS()
    this returns a number
  - =XMATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, match_mode, search_mode)
    this function is exactly like using [command] + [f] in Microsoft Word
  - =TRANSPOSE()
    this turns a table's columns into rows and rows into columns
    if using this function is giving you trouble, a work-around is to copy table -> paste special -> fill values -> transpose
  - =CONCAT()
    returns a string of text
  - =HLOOKUP()
    horizontal (row) lookup
    just like VLOOKUP but instead of columns, you are searching rows... just like XLOOKUP
  - =COUNTIF(range, criteria)
    Ex. COUNTIF(B9:B14, A3)
  - =COUNTIFS()
  - =SUMIF()
  - =SUMIFS()
