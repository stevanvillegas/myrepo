- A star schema is a description of datasets; consists of one or more fact tables which reference any number of dimension tables

- when using the "new source" action, make sure to use "transform table"
- to undo actions within Power BI, go to "Query Settings" view and [x] any undesirable "applied steps"
- use "duplicate" to copy a table (recommended), use reference for correlating changes (not commonly used)
- Conditional columns are columns created based on a condition imposed on an existing column
- DAX (data analysis expressions) is used for mathematical operations such as arithmetic, comparison, logical and text concatenation; similar to excel functions; creates insights
- Cardinality: each relationship can be modelled based on a cardinality type such as 1-1, 1-M, M-M
- Cross-filter direction: each relationship is defined with a cross filter direction, which determines the direction that filters propogate; a single cross filter refers to a "single direction", and both refers to "both directions"
- calculated columns return a value for each row
- a measure returns one same value
- slicers
- creating hierarchy in fields
